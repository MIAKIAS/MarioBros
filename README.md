# MarioBros

This is the final project from the 2020 ECE243S course in the University of Toronto. In this project, we used C language to implement a graphic game named "MarioBros". In the game, the player uses a PS/2 keyboard to control Mario to go toward the castle to rescue the princess. On the way to the castle, Mario has to dodge or beat Bad Mushrooms and Turtles to live. There are also Good Mushrooms that help Mario. Once Mario gets to the castle alive in a limited time, the player wins.

## Use a PS/2 keyboard to control Mr. Mario

- “Left” and “Right” key to control Mario move to left or right.
- “Up” key to control Mario to jump.

## The characters

- Mr. Mario, who is a plumber, controlled by the player.
- Good Mushroom, when touching it, Mario will get one more life.
- Bad Mushroom, when touching it, Mario will lose one life. The only way to defeat it is by stepping on its head.
- Turtle, Mario will also lose one life if touching it, but it will help Mario clear all enemies when Mario steps on its head.

## Buildings

- Steps: Mario can jump onto them.
- Steps with a question mark: Basically the same as the above steps, but it will give Mario money or release a Good mushroom when Mario hits them by his head.
- Pipes: Same as Steps, but have a different appearance.
- Castle: end of the game.

## Other backgrounds
- A time count
- Stars representing the number of lives
- Amount of money gain 
- Audios before game start, during the game, and when the game is over
